# Additional Configuration Options

## Disabling scenario / step definition validation

Cucumber's approach is to start with your feature file and execute the step definitions in the order defined in the feature file. In contrast, jest-cucumber scenarios are merely Jest tests. In order to provide the same ability as Cucumber to keep the feature files and step definitions in sync, jest-cucumber validates your step definitions against the feature file.

By default, this step definition / feature file validation is enabled. If you have scenarios that are defined in the feature file, but not in your step definitions for that feature file, jest-cucumber will raise an error (and provide starter code). If you have scenarios defined in your step definitions for that aren't in your feature file, jest-cucumber will also raise an error. Additionally, jest-cucumber also validates that the steps you define within your scenarios match the steps that are defined in the feature file, and are in the same order. 

If you would prefer not to have this validation occur (perhaps you just want to consume Gherkin tables in your feature file, etc.), then validation can be disabled like so:

```javascript
import { defineFeature, loadFeature } from 'jest-cucumber';

const feature = loadFeature('./features/RocketLaunching.feature', {
  errorOnMissingScenariosAndSteps: false
});
```

## Tag filtering

jest-cucumber has the ability to specify a tag filter. This simply causes jest-cucumber to ignore missing scenarios during validation that do not match the specified tag(s).

For example, consider the following feature file:

```gherkin
Feature: Tagged scenarios

  @included
  Scenario: Tagged scenario that is included
    Given my scenario has a tag that is included in my jest-cucumber step definitions tag filter
    But I don't have that scenario defined in my step definitions
    When I execute my jest-cucumber scenarios
    Then jest-cucumber should show me an error
  
  @not-included
  Scenario: Tagged scenario that is not included
    Given my scenario has a tag that is NOT included in my jest-cucumber step definitions tag filter
    But I don't have that scenario defined in my step definitions
    When I execute my jest-cucumber scenarios
    Then jest-cucumber should NOT show me an error
```

Consider the following step definitions file:

```javascript
import { defineFeature, loadFeature } from 'jest-cucumber';

const feature = loadFeature('./features/RocketLaunching.feature', {
  tagFilter: ['@included']
});

//No scenarios defined yet
```

In this case with a tag filter and no scenarios defined, jest-cucumber will raise an error about the first scenario, and will not raise an error about the second scenario.

## Scenario title templates

In some cases, having control more over the scenario titles is desired. For example, imagine scenarios that are tagged with with issue ids like so:

```
Feature: Tagged scenarios

    @issue-1234
    Scenario: Scenario tagged with issue
        ...
        ...
        ...        
```

Jest Cucumber allows a `scenarioNameTemplate` function to be provided to generate the scenario title as desired. For example:

```javascript
const feature = loadFeature('./examples/typescript/specs/features/basic-scenarios.feature', {
    scenarioNameTemplate: (vars) => {
        return `${vars.scenarioTitle} (${vars.scenarioTags.join(',')})`;
    }
});
```

The output scenario title in this case would be `Scenario tagged with issue (issue-1234)`.

The following info is available in the `vars` argument:

* `featureTitle` - string
* `featureTags` - string[]
* `scenarioTitle` - string
* `scenarioTags` - string[]
